## Steps to run the simulations 

1. Go to https://www.modcs.org/ and download Mercury software version 5.0.2
2. Download the models from this repository and open them in the Mercury software
3. To run the availability simulations you must open the file for the availability model and go to Evaluate -> SPN Evaluation -> Stationary Analysis and click on run.
4. To run the message sending and reliability simulations you must open the file for the message sending or reliability model and go to Evaluate -> SPN Evaluation -> Trasient Analysis and click run.
